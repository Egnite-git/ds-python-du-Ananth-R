I would be using the CSV format to persist the extracted data because there is a designated library called "csv" to read the file and the same can be used to add rows and columns.
One more reason is that I am comfortable using the csv file rather than the MySQL database.
And csv is easier to work with compared to MySQL as we would not have to link the database to our code.
Also,as we are extracting public data, high level security is not required.
